Security Cameras Installation Guidelines
Revision - 1/8/2023

Below are the guidelines: 

-	No hole installation is required i.e. no wiring through the walls.
-	The camera installation must follow any Washington state privacy and safety laws, see 9.73.130, 9.73.140. 
    (https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73&full=true).
-	The camera must not point to other owner’s property (i.e. neighbors) including neighbor’s windows, doors or patio/deck.
-	The camera light(s) area must not cover beyond 8 feet of the installation location within the owner’s property.
-	If installed in a open area, then the screws (attachment to the walls) must be covered with outdoor silicone sealant to prevent water damage. 

The owner will be responsible of any repair and removal expense(s) due to the faulty installation.
